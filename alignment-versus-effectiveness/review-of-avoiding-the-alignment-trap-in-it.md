Found it difficult to understand what criteria had been used to catergorise companies on the alignment/efficacy axises.  Would have been useful to show the methodology.

## Critical Principles Most Significant In Moving Organisations To High Effectiveness

### Emphasizing Simplicity

Easy to say, hard to deliver.

De Beers S.A. No standardisation across mines.  High licencing fee cost.  Replaced local applications with a single SAP enterprise resource planning system.

### 'Rightsourcing' Capabilities

Often makes sense for applications of a strategic nature or critical to competitive differentiation in-house.

National City Corp used to rely heavily on standard banking software from a leading vendor, but brought development in-house for selected areas that would allow the bank to differentiate itself from its competitors.

Outsourcing is best for things that you have a good understanding of.

De Beers S.A. ran it's own SAP call centres for 18 months until it could understand what was required to run them before it considered outsourcing.  In the end it just outsourced the help desk function.

Selective Insurance Group CIO said they can spec routine work which is then developed in India, before being integrated and tested by their in-house team.

### Creating end-to-end accountability

National City were aligned to business units but nobody was looking after the IT strategy as a whole.  Created a bourd to oversea the IT budget and IT decisions and enabled them to create a multiyear transformation program to replace antiquated pieces of the system.

## From effectiveness to growth

Nestle standardised data management, systems and operating practices at 80% of its businesses and turned over IT governance to the business (isn't this the opposite of removing the alignment from business functions?  perhaps the it was a organisation-wide initiative but a business unit executive was made accountable for the projects results).

First Data Corp also turned over the reins of IT governance to the business.  They decoupled the company's products from individual IT platforms in order to lower costs and make the IT underpinnings of First Data's products more effective (what does that even mean?!)

Keep track of where to focus (effectiveness or alignment) by tracking proportion of IT spend required for maintenance against that spent on product development.

Seems to suggest that you align IT along business function lines, but you make it more effective by making IT responsible for itself.
